# Calories Burnt Prediction

This project is a Data Science solution that predicts the number of calories burnt during physical activities based on biometric and exercise-related data. The model leverages supervised machine learning techniques to analyze key features like age, weight, height, duration, and heart rate to provide accurate calorie burn estimations.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Goal**: To predict the calories burnt using biometric and workout data.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **ML Models Used**: Linear Regression (can be extended to other regressors)

## 🔍 Dataset

The dataset includes the following features:
- Gender
- Age
- Height
- Weight
- Duration
- Heart Rate
- Body Temperature
- **Target Variable**: Calories

> Note: Dataset is assumed to be included in the project or externally sourced. If not available, it should be added to the `/data` folder.
